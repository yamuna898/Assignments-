/*
Sir, I first tried the code that you've wrote on board
but it was not printing without semicolon.

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    char name = 'Yamuna';   // this wasn't working properly
    if(name){ printf(name) }  //ERROR here "missing semicoln"
    return 0;
}

In lab sir told we can use scanf inside if,
so I tried same with printf and it worked without a semicoln.
